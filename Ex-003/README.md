# Description:

## definitions:

1. ***Invasive ductal carcinoma*** `IDC`, also known as infiltrating ductal carcinoma, is a type of breast cancer that starts in the milk ducts of the breast and moves into nearby tissue. In time, IDC may spread `metastasize` through the lymph nodes or bloodstream to other areas of the body.
2. ***Mucinous carcinoma*** is a rare type of cancer. In mucinous carcinoma, cancer cells form in mucin, the main component of mucus. Mucins are proteins that help with the function of healthy cells. In mucinous carcinoma, the mucin around cancer cells becomes part of the tumor.
3. ***Invasive lobular carcinoma*** `ILC`, also known as infiltrating lobular carcinoma, begins in the milk-producing glands `lobules` of the breast. As an invasive type of cancer, ILC has spread beyond its original tumor site. Over time, ILC may become metastatic breast cancer.
4. ***modified radical mastectomy*** is a procedure in which the entire breast is removed, including the skin, areola, nipple, and most axillary lymph nodes, but the pectoralis major muscle is spared. Historically, a modified radical mastectomy was the primary method of treatment for breast cancer.
5. ***simple mastectomy*** is a surgery to remove cancer from the breast.a simple mastectomy removes the breast tissue, nipple, areola and skin but not all the lymph nodes.
6. ***lumpectomy*** is a surgery to remove cancer from the breast. Unlike a mastectomy, a lumpectomy removes only the tumor and a small rim of normal tissue around it. It leaves most of the breast skin and tissue in place. With a lumpectomy, the breast looks as close as possible to how it did before surgery.
7. ***Cancer Spread*** is the process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body is called metastasis. When observed under a microscope and tested in other ways, metastatic cancer cells have features like that of the primary cancer and not like the cells in the place where the metastatic cancer is found.۲۰ آبان ۱۳۹۹


## Cancer number staging system
1. stage 1 – the cancer is small and hasn't spread anywhere else.
2. stage 2 – the cancer has grown, but hasn't spread.
3. stage 3 – the cancer is larger and may have spread to the surrounding tissues and/or the lymph nodes (or "glands", part of the immune system)

## Cancer status types
1. ***ER status*** : the cancer cells grow in response to the hormone estrogen.About 80% of all breast cancers are `ER-positive`.
2. ***PR status*** : the cancer cells grow in response to another hormone, progesterone. About 65% of these are also `PR-positive`.
3. ***HR status*** : If your breast cancer has a significant number of receptors for either estrogen or progesterone, it’s considered `hormone-receptor positive`.
4. ***HER2 status*** :In about 20% of breast cancers, the cells make too much of a protein known as `HER2`. These cancers tend to be aggressive and fast-growing.
5. In this case, hormone receptor status gives information about your breast cancer. If your breast cancer is ER-positive, PR-positive and HER2-positive, it may be called ***triple positive breast cancer***. If your breast cancer is ER-negative, PR-negative and HER2-negative, it may be called ***triple negative breast cancer***.
6. Some breast cancers -- between 10% and 20% -- are known as `Triple-negative` because they don’t have estrogen and progesterone receptors and don’t overexpress the HER2 protein. Many breast cancers associated with the gene BRCA1 are triple negative. They are often treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
7. `Triple-positive` breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that occurs when breast cancer cells use estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) protein to grow. Triple-positive breast cancer is a subtype of HER2 positive breast cancer; it accounts for about 10% of all breast cancer diagnoses.
6. Tumors that are ER/PR-positive are much more likely to respond to hormone therapy than tumors that are ER/PR-negative.
